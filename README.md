# STL
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes designed to provide general-purpose algorithms and data structures. It includes four main components:

# Containers: 
    Data structures like vector, list, set, map, etc., which store collections of objects.
# Iterators: 
    Objects that point to elements in containers and allow traversal through the container, like pointers.
# Algorithms: 
    Functions like sort, find, reverse, etc., that operate on ranges of elements.
# Functors: 
    Objects that can be treated as functions or function pointers, often used in algorithms.
STL is highly efficient, versatile, and integral to modern C++ programming, enabling developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code.
